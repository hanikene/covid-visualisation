# covid-visualisation

A React app that fetch covid-19 data from mathdroid's covid-19-api and display chart statistics from them. In this project, I used hooks, Typescript, Chakra-ui and Apex charts for displaying the statistics. You can see the preview here: https://corona-chart-react.herokuapp.com/
